I mainly use this repository to keep track of my own codewars progress.
I'll potentially add new content very infrequently.

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire

- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform

### Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also help going to interviews more confident and learning a few tricks of your prefered language.
I highly recommend the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which will help you ace your next technical interview.

### Repository Structure

There's a folder for each language. Katas are nested in their own kyu.
