/// # Easy Wallpaper
///
/// John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that making sure he has the right
/// amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds.
/// He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
/// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of
/// h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters.
/// The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra
/// length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15%
/// greater than the one he needs.
/// Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?
/// Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number
/// of rolls he must buy.
